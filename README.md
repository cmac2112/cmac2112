- <b> All Archived projects are retired and no longer are being considered to be iterated upon, these projects are old and are a testament to the learning i have undertaken over the past several years of building things. It is not uncommon to see weird decisions and mistakes in these repos. All I ask for is a little mercy on my past sweet little innocent college soul who did not know much at the time </b> :)
